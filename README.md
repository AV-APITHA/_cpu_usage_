CPU Usage Prediction
ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project predicts CPU usage from tabular system metrics. It demonstrates:
Data versioning with DVC
Reproducible ML pipelines (preprocess â†’ train â†’ evaluate)
Model training and evaluation

âš™ Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/AV-APITHA/_cpu_usage_.git
cd AV-APITHA
2. Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Pull datasets tracked with DVC:
dvc pull

ðŸš€ Running the Pipeline
Run the full pipeline:
dvc repro
> Note: Trained models and MLflow artifacts are ignored in GitHub (listed in .gitignore).
ðŸ“ˆ Results & Evaluation
Evaluation metrics (RMSE, MAE, RÂ²) are computed during the evaluation stage.
Residual plots and feature importance plots are generated locally in your environment.
MLflow is used to track experiments and log parameters, metrics, and models locally.
